Objective:
Beat the dealer by getting the count closest to 21, without going over 21.

Card Value:
Each card has a point equal to its number. Jack, Queen, and King has a value of 10. Ace has 11 points.

Gameplay:
At the start of the game, you are dealt two cards while the dealer takes one card. You are given two options,
either to get another card, or pass on the turn to the dealer.

If you feel you can get another card without going over 21, you may choose to get another card, after which you 
are presented the option again.

If you don't want another card, you can pass on the turn to the dealer. You will not be able to get cards again,
so choose wisely. If the dealer has exceeded 21 in his turn, you win the game. If he gets a count higher than
yours, but lower than 21, you lose the game.
